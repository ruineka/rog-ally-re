it fucking works!! I've tested it dozens of times, it works flawlessly! WagesOf script and this service file: deck@rog-ally ~ $

put this in /lib/systemd/system-sleep/systemd-suspend-nkeyfix.sh
#!/bin/bash

case "$1" in
    pre)
            #code execution BEFORE sleeping/hibernating/suspending
    ;;
    post)
           sleep 2
           echo "Post suspend check for N-Key" > /dev/kmsg
           if grep -Fxq 'ROG Ally' "/sys/devices/virtual/dmi/id/product_family" ; then
                if [[ $(lsusb | grep "0b05:1abe") == "" ]]; then
            echo "Post suspend reinit to find N-Key" > /dev/kmsg
             echo platform > /sys/power/pm_test
                    echo freeze > /sys/power/state
                    echo none > /sys/power/pm_test
                 fi
            fi

for some reason it wasn't executed on /lib/systemd/system/system-sleep

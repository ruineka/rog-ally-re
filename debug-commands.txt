USB Debug Stuff

usbcore.quirks=
    [USB] A list of quirk entries to augment the built-in
    usb core quirk list. List entries are separated by
    commas. Each entry has the form VendorID:ProductID:Flags.
    The IDs are 4-digit hex numbers and Flags is a set of letters.
    Each letter will change the built-in quirk; setting it if it is
    clear and clearing it if it is set. The letters have the following meanings:
            a = USB_QUIRK_STRING_FETCH_255 (string
                descriptors must not be fetched using
                a 255-byte read);
            b = USB_QUIRK_RESET_RESUME (device can't resume
                correctly so reset it instead);
            c = USB_QUIRK_NO_SET_INTF (device can't handle
                Set-Interface requests);
            d = USB_QUIRK_CONFIG_INTF_STRINGS (device can't
                handle its Configuration or Interface
                strings);
            e = USB_QUIRK_RESET (device can't be reset
                (e.g morph devices), don't use reset);
            f = USB_QUIRK_HONOR_BNUMINTERFACES (device has
                more interface descriptions than the
                bNumInterfaces count, and can't handle
                talking to these interfaces);
            g = USB_QUIRK_DELAY_INIT (device needs a pause
                during initialization, after we read
                the device descriptor);
            h = USB_QUIRK_LINEAR_UFRAME_INTR_BINTERVAL (For
                high speed and super speed interrupt
                endpoints, the USB 2.0 and USB 3.0 spec
                require the interval in microframes (1
                microframe = 125 microseconds) to be
                calculated as interval = 2 ^
                (bInterval-1).
                Devices with this quirk report their
                bInterval as the result of this
                calculation instead of the exponent
                variable used in the calculation);
            i = USB_QUIRK_DEVICE_QUALIFIER (device can't
                handle device_qualifier descriptor
                requests);
            j = USB_QUIRK_IGNORE_REMOTE_WAKEUP (device
                generates spurious wakeup, ignore
                remote wakeup capability);
            k = USB_QUIRK_NO_LPM (device can't handle Link
                Power Management);
            l = USB_QUIRK_LINEAR_FRAME_INTR_BINTERVAL
                (Device reports its bInterval as linear
                frames instead of the USB 2.0
                calculation);
            m = USB_QUIRK_DISCONNECT_SUSPEND (Device needs
                to be disconnected before suspend to
                prevent spurious wakeup);
            n = USB_QUIRK_DELAY_CTRL_MSG (Device needs a
                pause after every control message);
            o = USB_QUIRK_HUB_SLOW_RESET (Hub needs extra
                delay after resetting its port);
    Example: quirks=0781:5580:bk,0a5c:5834:gij


# Test platform pm_test (This uses global ACPI methods) and devices pm_test (This does userspace and device suspend only without ACPI)
echo platform > /sys/power/pm_test
echo freeze > /sys/power/state
echo none > /sys/power/pm_test

# Very useful dynamic debugging
echo 'module xhci_hcd +pflm' > /sys/kernel/debug/dynamic_debug/control
echo 'module usbcore +pflm' > /sys/kernel/debug/dynamic_debug/control

# Bind/Unbind USB
echo "1-3" > /sys/bus/usb/drivers/usb/bind
echo "1-3" > /sys/bus/usb/drivers/usb/unbind

# Send ACPI Call
echo '\_SB_.PCI0.SBRG.EC0._Q0A' > /proc/acpi/call (This will put the device to sleep by sending the SLPB command)
echo '\_SB_.PCI0.SBRG.EC0._QDE' > /proc/acpi/call (This will send the power button event to put the system to sleep)

# Send WMI keyboard events by ACPI Call
echo '\_SB_.ATKD.IANE' 0x31 > /proc/acpi/call (Send volume down button)
